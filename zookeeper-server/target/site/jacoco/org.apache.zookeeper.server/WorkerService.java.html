/**
 * WorkerService is a worker thread pool for running tasks and is implemented
 * using one or more ExecutorServices. A WorkerService can support assignable
 * threads, which it does by creating N separate single thread ExecutorServices,
 * or non-assignable threads, which it does by creating a single N-thread
 * ExecutorService.
 *   - NIOServerCnxnFactory uses a non-assignable WorkerService because the
 *     socket IO requests are order independent and allowing the
 *     ExecutorService to handle thread assignment gives optimal performance.
 *   - CommitProcessor uses an assignable WorkerService because requests for
 *     a given session must be processed in order.
 * ExecutorService provides queue management and thread restarting, so it's
 * useful even with a single thread.
